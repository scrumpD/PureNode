# PureNode Text Adventure Engine

## Overview
**PureNode** is an attempt at implementing node-oriented text games using purely functional logic. Developed in Haskell, it manipulates pattern matching and recursive function calls to navigate players through custom-made scenarios. Each game prompt, or 'node', offers multiple choices that move the ludic narrative, affecting subsequent interactions and outcomes. The architecture supports easy addition or modification of nodes, making it an adaptable foundation for building complex, narrative-driven games.
